# Programming Problems in Rust

Solutions to the exercises found at https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html

Not every exercise has been solved, something I may get around to in the future.

## Organization

Every solution is compiled as its own binary (see Cargo.toml). Build all solutions with `cargo build`.

Elementary solutions source code can be found under `src/elementary/N-description.rs` where `N` is the exercise number. Run a solution with `cargo run --bin elementary-N` where `N` is the exercise number.

List, strings solutions source code can be found under `src/list, strings/N-description.rs` where `N` is the exercise number. Run a solution with `cargo run --bin liststrings-N` where `N` is the exercise number.

Intermediate solutions source code can be found under `src/intermediate/N-description.rs` where `N` is the exercise number. Run a solution with `cargo run --bin intermediate-N` where `N` is the exercise number.
